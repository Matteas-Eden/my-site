## Intro

Hi, I'm Matt. I like computers a lot, and on occasion I use them for something mildly productive. This is a simple portfolio site which has some rudimentary info around me, a mini-showcase of some projects I don't hide out of embarrassment and a straightforward contact form if you want to get in touch.

**Take a look:** [matteas.nz](https://matteas.nz)
## Development

This site was built using the [Gatsby Dimension Starter](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension), and therefore inherits all of its dependencies.

## Running Locally

The process for running this locally is really, really simple. Here's a rundown:
```
git clone https://github.com/Matteas-Eden/my-site
cd my-site
yarn install
yarn develop
```

Once you've done that, you should be able to spin up your browser of choice and navigate to the site at: `localhost:8000`.
